First off, this post isn't about a "better way to think" or some kind of silver bullet about how you need to lead your life. It is just my opinion on life as a whole. So, take what you need and follow what you think is fair.

The topics don't correlate with each other; they are just thoughts about thoughts, and more thoughts.

## Your last year

Did you do everything that you planned last year? To be honest, I didn't. But this doesn't mean that I failed or anything like that; it just reminds me that I'm human and bla bla bla bullshit.

Yes, you need to be better. You know you're probably a procrastinator of the highest order who blames others, like politicians or *Stranger Things* Season 5 (bad as fuck).

Stop being a coward and face your stupid life. If you don't study, you will be just another face in the crowd. Even *if* you study, you have a 93% chance of still being just that—so imagine if you don't study at all.

Why should you focus on studying? Because if you are reading this shit, it's because you studied how to read, how to understand words, and how to interpret them. It's the same for other areas: your job, your relationships, your video games (I know you are Bronze 3 in League of Legends). If you want to change, first start studying, start thinking, start criticizing.

Yes, I'm an engineer, but this doesn't mean I need to study sharded storage all the time. I can study history, biology, medicine, art—anything that makes you happier is valid.

## The eternal loop of finding the "correct" wrench

I often see people on LinkedIn (or other creepy sites) falling into just two categories: the guy who needs to impress to find a better job eventually, and the guy who believes the guy trying to impress.

Stop being a fool thinking about the absolute "best" language or tool for your non-specific use case. Remember: 99% of your work can be done with PHP, Rust, or even HolyC. It doesn't matter. You just need to keep latency under 1s (which is easy if you are a decent engineer), and your end client won't even think about lag.

This isn't just about engineering; it is about life in general. Stop trying to find the best spot, the best way, the best outcome. Some actions just need to be "bad" actions to open the door for future good actions.

The tool is often not the problem—your stuck mind is. You obsess over which framework to use just to display a simple list of data, or what color your t-shirt needs to be to impress the HR girl. So, stop being a dumbass carrying a dictionary of programming languages under your arm or shooting at useless targets, and start being a great engineer and human who can actually solve problems with any wrench at any time.

Okay, okay, some problems really do need a specific wrench. But that is probably not your case. If it were, you wouldn't be reading this; you’d be reading "Dependent types and their applications in the subworld of metatypes" or some shit like that.

> Remember: The hand holding the wrench is the one that matters!

I added this topic just to see if you are reading—like leaving a cake recipe on the first page of your homework to see if your professor actually reads the papers or just grades based on your gender and nationality.

## What should I study?

What you like. Next question.

---

Okay, let's delve into this. When I'm losing my mind about what topics I should study, I use two approaches. First:

### Study a little bit of everything

This is the easiest and most rewarding option. Even if you spend a month studying a "useless" topic, you will probably learn something to do (or not to do) regarding a specific area, or just learn to think in a different way. IDK! Just fill your brain with info until you look at something special and—BAM—you realize, "This is what I should study for my entire life," or at least half of it.

Let me give you an example:

Some months ago I faced this same question, and I just started studying everything that I thought I might like. To be straightforward, I noticed that I hate a lot of things.

I spent 3 months studying cybersecurity. This didn't make me a pentester, but I learned a lot about how networks and encryption work, so... worth as fuck. And these studies led me to DevOps things, like AWS and k8s, which brought me back to an old topic that I like too: distributed systems. That is what I really like and what I'm studying right now.

At the same time, I did a little exploration into Lean4 and noticed that I hate dependent types and any nerd shit like that. Maybe in my future mathematician days I will return to this topic, but I decided to take a 10-year break from it starting now.

### Can I really understand this?

Another way that you can use with the previous segment is asking exactly the title: "Can I really understand this?"

- If the answer is yes: okay, just study.
- If the answer is no: take a step back and repeat the question.

When I did this, I had to go all the way back to programming logic, but it was worth it!

### Another bad way to study

Studying React and PHP to become a millionaire. (It's a joke, okay?)

## What to do when some bad shit happens

In this topic, let's take four examples and break them down.

### 1 - You lost your job

Do you have savings to survive, or are you a dumbass like me who just spent all your money on useless and crazy stuff?

If the answer is: "I didn't save anything," welcome to the club. My advice for you is: focus on your greatest skill and show it to people who can find you a job (a friend or some HR human). Build fast and show it even faster to survive.

If the answer is: "I saved a lot, bro!!", just spend everything and do the first solution—you only have one life. Or, take a break and think if you really are on the correct path or doing the right thing. Care about your relationships, your friends, and your wife. Care about your sanity and physical health. But I really recommend the first approach.

### 2 - Some big shit happened at your job

Can you deal with it? If not, just ignore it. If you can, try to minimize the loss and explain to people why they are losing less than with other solutions.

At some point in space-time, you will fall into a big problem—a big one that you created, or one that a dumbass created (you can be both). Knowing how to deal with this is a great skill to stay alive (seriously talking).

Try to lose less or focus on earning more in another area. Every problem has a backdoor where you can be the explorer and the hero of the company, or a 99% chance to just ruin everything further and drag everyone into the hole with you. Flip your coin.

### 3 - A really bad thing happened in your personal life

Take a break and think about it. Can you solve this? No? Just try to stay calm and solve other problems.

Can you solve it? So solve it. Simple.

### 4 - You just don't want to do anything anymore

Find a therapist, my friend. Stay safe!

## Thinking about life in general

Every time I take a shower, I realize one thing for certain: right now, this is my life, and my only option is to grab it tight. Is this an illusion? I don't care; it's just what I have. Have I already died? I don't care; it's just what I have. Could I still be stoned from that weed I smoked 5 years ago? I don't care; it's just what I have.

Your actual experience is everything you have. You don't have your past anymore, and your future hasn't rendered yet; everything is just this present instant of life right now—and you, like a dumbass, are reading this shit.

When you are making a decision, remember this: you don't get another chance (as far as you know). So take care of what you love, and plan to have a better future.

Could you die 5 minutes after reading this? Yep. That doesn't change the fact that this is all you have to hold onto.

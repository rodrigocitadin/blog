The OSI model and TCP/IP underlie everything we do on the web, from visiting a site and watching a video to liking tweets or having your printer receive a document.

## Introduction

First, we need to briefly understand what these two concepts are, as they are not the same. The OSI model is a standard that outlines how networking should occur. It consists of seven layers, which define the rules and methods for how a frame transforms into a packet and how a packet becomes information that your computer can understand. In contrast, the TCP/IP model takes a more focused approach, consisting of generally four to five layers derived from the OSI model.

As you can see, they are quite similar, with TCP incorporating OSI features. In the following sections, I will discuss all the layers, focusing more on those that are particularly useful for web applications in general.

## Physical

The layers are numbered bottom-up, so the Physical layer is the first. This is where electricity, light pulses, or both come into play. We won't discuss this layer much because it deals with more engineering-related issues, like wires and how electricity turns into bits. What you need to know is that this is where the physical elements live (as the name of the layer suggests).

## Data Link

Here we focus on network standards such as WiFi 802.11 and Ethernet 802.3. This layer acts as a medium for transmitting signals. One important component is the Media Access Control (MAC), which is represented by two hexadecimal characters separated by a colon, forming a total of six pairs of characters.

When examining a packet, we typically find a source MAC address that is sending the packet and a destination MAC address that is receiving it. You may wonder why we need MAC addresses when we already have IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The answer is straightforward: IP operates at layer 3 of the OSI model, while MAC operates at layer 2. This division of responsibilities is importantâ€”MAC addresses identify "Who is this computer?" while IP addresses indicate "Where is this computer?" 

Additionally, IP addresses can change frequently; they may vary when you switch networks or reset your router, whereas MAC addresses remain constant. IP relies on network topology, while MAC addresses are tied to the hardware of the network adapter.

## Network

Data Link Layer sends data between two nodes in the same network, here we will explore new oceans, Network layer goes to outside, send and receive data from different networks. Let's look at IP protocol, subnets, submasks, default gateways, public and private addresses. We will not dive in ICMP, VPN or SSL/TLS here, just talk about the basics, I will do another posts later about SSL/TLS and VPN.
